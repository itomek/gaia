# Dependency Management

## What is Dependabot?

Dependabot automatically monitors dependencies and can create pull requests for security updates and version upgrades. This keeps GAIA's Python and JavaScript dependencies current and secure.

## Understanding Dependabot Modes

### Mode 1: Auto-PR Mode (`open-pull-requests-limit: 1` or higher)
- ✅ **Monitors** dependencies for updates
- ✅ **Creates pull requests** automatically when updates are available
- ✅ **Runs CI tests** to validate the update
- Best for: Critical dependencies where you want automatic updates with testing

### Mode 2: Monitor-Only Mode (`open-pull-requests-limit: 0`)
- ✅ **Monitors** dependencies for updates
- ✅ **Shows alerts** in GitHub Security tab for vulnerabilities
- ❌ **Does NOT create** pull requests automatically
- Best for: Dependencies you want to update manually or on your own schedule

## Current Configuration

### Root NPM Workspace (Auto-PR Mode)
The root `package.json` uses npm workspaces and includes:
- `src/gaia/electron` - Electron framework
- `src/gaia/apps/*/webui` - All app subdirectories

**Configuration:**
```yaml
directory: "/"
open-pull-requests-limit: 1
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ Dependabot **creates PRs** for Electron framework dependencies
- ✅ Dependabot **creates PRs** for all workspace packages
- ✅ PRs are grouped together to reduce noise
- ✅ Automated tests run on these PRs via GitHub Actions

**Example:** [PR #853](https://github.com/aigdat/gaia/pull/853) was automatically created by Dependabot for electron framework updates.

### Individual Apps (Monitor-Only Mode) - OPTIONAL

**Note:** These individual app configurations are **optional** because the root NPM workspace already scans all apps. They are included to allow fine-grained control if needed in the future.

Each app *can* have its own configuration for specific control:
- `src/gaia/apps/example/webui`
- `src/gaia/apps/jira/webui`
- `src/gaia/eval/webapp`

**Configuration:**
```yaml
directory: "/src/gaia/apps/[app-name]/webui"
open-pull-requests-limit: 0
```

**What this provides (optional):**
- Different update schedules per app (monthly vs weekly)
- Different labels for organization and filtering
- Ability to enable/disable PRs per app independently
- Currently all set to `0` (monitoring only) since root workspace handles PRs

**Recommendation:** The individual app entries can be **removed** if you don't need app-specific schedules or labels, since the root workspace configuration already handles dependency updates for all apps via npm workspaces.

## When to Add Your App

**Important:** If your app is part of the npm workspaces (listed in root `package.json`), it's **already being monitored** by the root NPM configuration. You only need to add a separate configuration if you want:
- App-specific labels for GitHub organization
- Different update schedule (e.g., monthly instead of weekly)
- Ability to enable/disable PRs for this app independently

Add your app to `.github/dependabot.yml` if:

- ✅ It has a `package.json` file (JavaScript/npm dependencies)
- ✅ It's located in `src/gaia/apps/`
- ✅ You want app-specific configuration (otherwise root workspace handles it)

**Current Status:** All apps in `src/gaia/apps/*/webui` are already scanned via the root workspace configuration. Individual app entries exist for organizational purposes but can be removed if not needed.

## How to Add Your App

### 1. Edit `.github/dependabot.yml`

Add this configuration for your app:

```yaml
  # JavaScript - [Your App Name] (monitor only, no PRs)
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/src/gaia/apps/[your-app-name]/webui"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "javascript"
      - "[your-app-name]-app"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 0
    groups:
      [your-app-name]-app-dependencies:
        patterns:
          - "*"
```

### 2. Real Example

Here's how the Jira app is configured:

```yaml
  # JavaScript - Jira app (monitor only, no PRs)
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/src/gaia/apps/jira/webui"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "javascript"
      - "jira-app"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 0
    groups:
      jira-app-dependencies:
        patterns:
          - "*"
```

### 3. Important Notes

- **Directory path**: Must exactly match your app's webui folder (e.g., `/src/gaia/apps/example/webui`)
- **App name**: Use consistent naming in labels and group name
- **Schedule**: Use `monthly` for most apps
- **PR Limit**: Apps use `open-pull-requests-limit: 0` (monitoring only). Root Python dependencies use `open-pull-requests-limit: 1` (one PR at a time for core updates)

## Configuration Reference

### Update Schedules

- `weekly` - Python core, GitHub Actions (with `open-pull-requests-limit: 1`)
- `monthly` - Apps and POC examples (with `open-pull-requests-limit: 0`)

### PR Limits Strategy

| Component | Limit | Behavior | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Python core dependencies | 1 | Creates PRs automatically | One PR at a time for critical updates |
| GitHub Actions | 1 | Creates PRs automatically | One PR at a time |
| Root NPM workspace | 1 | Creates PRs automatically | Includes Electron framework + all apps via workspaces |
| Individual apps | 0 | Monitor only - alerts without PRs | Fine-grained control per app |

**Important:** The root NPM configuration (`directory: "/"`) uses npm workspaces, which means it automatically includes:
- Electron framework (`src/gaia/electron`)
- All apps (`src/gaia/apps/*/webui`)

This is why you see PRs like [#853](https://github.com/aigdat/gaia/pull/853) for Electron framework updates - they come from the root workspace configuration.

**Auto-PR Mode (`limit: 1`):** Dependabot creates pull requests automatically, runs tests, and you can review/merge them.

**Monitor-Only Mode (`limit: 0`):** Dependabot only shows security alerts in GitHub's Security tab without creating PRs. This prevents PR noise while maintaining visibility.

**Automated Testing:** When dependencies are updated, automated tests run via GitHub Actions to ensure compatibility. See the [Electron Testing Guide](../tests/electron/README.md) for details.

### Dependency Grouping

The `groups` section combines all dependency updates into a single PR instead of creating dozens of separate PRs. This reduces noise and makes reviews easier.

### Configuration Fields

- `package-ecosystem`: Package manager type (`npm`, `pip`, `github-actions`)
- `directory`: Path to folder containing `package.json`
- `schedule.interval`: How often to check (`weekly` or `monthly`)
- `labels`: Tags added to PRs for filtering
- `open-pull-requests-limit`: Max concurrent PRs (`0` = monitor only, `1+` = create PRs)
- `groups`: Combine related updates into single PR

## Automated Testing

All Electron framework and app dependencies are automatically tested when updated. The test suite includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Core Electron modules (AppController, WindowManager, MCPClient)
- **Integration Tests**: App configuration, structure, and dependencies
- **Build Tests**: Package and distribution verification
- **Security Audits**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

Tests run automatically on:
- Dependabot PRs for dependency updates
- Pull requests modifying Electron or app code
- Manual workflow dispatch

See [Electron Testing Guide](../tests/electron/README.md) for details on running tests locally.
