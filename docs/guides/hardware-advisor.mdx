---

The Hardware Advisor agent helps you figure out what size LLM your system can run by detecting your actual hardware capabilities.

<Info>
**Privacy-First:** All hardware detection runs locally on your machine. No data leaves your system.
</Info>

## Quick Start

```bash
python examples/hardware_advisor_agent.py
```

This starts an interactive session where you can ask about your hardware and get language model recommendations.

---

## Example Interactions

**Check your hardware:**
```
You: Show me my system specs

Agent: Let me check your hardware...
- RAM: 32 GB
- GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (24 GB VRAM)
- NPU: Ryzen AI NPU (Available)
- Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X
```

**Get recommendations:**
```
You: What size LLM can I run?

Agent: With 32 GB RAM, you can safely run models up to ~22 GB.
Top recommendations:
- Qwen3-Coder-30B (18.5 GB) - Best for coding
- Llama-3.1-8B (4.7 GB) - Great general purpose
```

**Check specific models:**
```
You: Can I run a 70B model?

Agent: A 70B model typically requires ~42 GB, which exceeds your
32 GB RAM. I'd recommend the 30B variant instead, which fits
comfortably in your available memory.
```

## How It Works

The agent uses three tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_hardware_info()` | Detects RAM, GPU, NPU via Lemonade Server |
| `list_available_models()` | Queries model catalog with size estimates |
| `recommend_models()` | Filters models using the 70% RAM rule |

**The 70% Rule:** Models should use less than 70% of available RAM to leave 30% overhead for inference operations (KV cache, context window, etc.).

---

## Requirements

- **Lemonade Server** must be running for hardware detection
- **GAIA** installed: `uv pip install amd-gaia`

<Tip>
GAIA auto-starts Lemonade Server on first use if it's not already running.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Lemonade Server not running">
**Error:** `Failed to get hardware information from Lemonade Server`

**Solution:** Start Lemonade Server:
```bash
lemonade-server serve
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GPU not detected">
**Possible causes:**
- **Windows:** PowerShell may be restricted. Run as administrator.
- **Linux:** `lspci` not installed. Install with: `sudo apt install pciutils`

**Note:** The agent continues with CPU-only recommendations if GPU detection fails.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="NPU shows as unavailable">
**Requirements for NPU:**
- Ryzen AI processor (8000/9000 series)
- NPU drivers installed
- Lemonade Server configured for NPU

The agent works without NPU - it just won't recommend NPU-accelerated models.
</Accordion>
