This guide clarifies what goes where in GAIA documentation and how to contribute.

---

## The Problem

Section names can be confusing:
- "SDK Reference" in Documentation tab vs "SDKs" in Specifications tab - what's the difference?
- "User Guides" vs "Playbooks" - when to use which?
- "Reference" vs "Specifications" - aren't they the same?

This guide provides clear definitions and decision criteria.

---

## Documentation Tab

### User Guides (`docs/guides/`)

**Definition:** Task-oriented tutorials teaching users how to accomplish goals with GAIA features.

**Contains:**
- Step-by-step instructions
- CLI commands users can run
- Working Python code examples
- Troubleshooting sections

**When to use:** User asks "How do I chat with PDF documents?"

**When NOT to use:** User asks "What parameters does ChatConfig accept?" → That's a Specification

**Example:** [docs/guides/chat.mdx](https://github.com/amd/gaia/blob/main/docs/guides/chat.mdx)

---

### Playbooks (`docs/playbooks/`)

**Definition:** Multi-part tutorials for building agents from scratch, with deep explanations of why things work.

**Contains:**
- 3+ part series
- Architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
- "Under the Hood" explanations
- Complete working code at the end

**When to use:** Teaching someone to BUILD a new agent type from scratch

**When NOT to use:** Explaining how to USE an existing agent → That's a Guide

**Example:** [docs/playbooks/chat-agent/](https://github.com/amd/gaia/tree/main/docs/playbooks/chat-agent)

---

### SDK Reference (`docs/sdk/sdks/`)

**Definition:** Quick code snippets for rapid development - "cheat sheets" developers copy-paste.

**Contains:**
- Import statements
- Common usage patterns (5-10 lines each)
- No step-by-step tutorials
- Links to full specifications

**When to use:** Developer asks "What's the quick way to do streaming chat?"

**When NOT to use:** Developer asks "What are ALL the methods on ChatSDK?" → That's a Specification

**Example:** [docs/sdk/sdks/chat.mdx](https://github.com/amd/gaia/blob/main/docs/sdk/sdks/chat.mdx)

---

## Specifications Tab

### SDK Specifications (`docs/spec/*-sdk.mdx`, `docs/spec/*-client.mdx`)

**Definition:** Complete technical contracts for SDK modules - ALL methods, parameters, types, and internals.

**Contains:**
- Full API with every method signature
- All parameters with types, defaults, descriptions
- Implementation details and testing requirements
- Extension points for contributors

**When to use:** Developer needs to know ALL methods on a class, or wants to extend the SDK

**When NOT to use:** Developer just wants to quickly use the SDK → That's SDK Reference or a Guide

**Example:** [docs/spec/llm-client.mdx](https://github.com/amd/gaia/blob/main/docs/spec/llm-client.mdx)

---

### Infrastructure Specifications (`docs/spec/api-server.mdx`, `docs/spec/mcp-*.mdx`)

**Definition:** Technical architecture of GAIA's backend systems - servers, bridges, registries.

**Contains:**
- Functional/Non-Functional Requirements
- Complete Pydantic schemas
- Request/response formats
- Internal implementation logic

**When to use:** Developer needs to understand or extend backend infrastructure

**When NOT to use:** User just wants to start the API server → That's Reference

---

## Reference Tab

### CLI Reference (`docs/reference/cli.mdx`)

**Definition:** Complete documentation of all CLI commands, flags, and options.

**When to use:** User asks "What flags does `gaia chat` accept?"

### API Reference (`docs/reference/api.mdx`)

**Definition:** User-facing guide for using the REST API server.

**When to use:** User asks "How do I use the API server?" (not "How is it built?" - that's a Specification)

## Comparison Tables

### SDK Reference vs SDK Specification

| Aspect | SDK Reference (`docs/sdk/sdks/`) | SDK Specification (`docs/spec/`) |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Quick usage examples | Complete technical contract |
| **Length** | ~100-200 lines | ~800-1400 lines |
| **Content** | Copy-paste snippets | Full API signatures, internals |
| **Audience** | Developers USING the SDK | Developers EXTENDING the SDK |

### Guides vs Playbooks

| Aspect | User Guides (`docs/guides/`) | Playbooks (`docs/playbooks/`) |
|--------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | USE pre-built features | BUILD agents from scratch |
| **Format** | Single page tutorial | Multi-part series (3+ parts) |
| **Output** | User accomplishes a task | User builds a complete agent |

### Reference vs Specifications

| Aspect | Reference (`docs/reference/`) | Specifications (`docs/spec/`) |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Focus** | User-facing tools | Internal architecture |
| **Audience** | Users and operators | SDK developers and contributors |

## Decision Tree

**"I want to document..."**

1. **How to USE a feature** → User Guide (`docs/guides/`)
2. **How to BUILD an agent from scratch** → Playbook (`docs/playbooks/`)
3. **Quick code snippets for developers** → SDK Reference (`docs/sdk/sdks/`)
4. **Complete API contract (all methods)** → Specification (`docs/spec/`)
5. **CLI commands and flags** → CLI Reference (`docs/reference/cli.mdx`)
6. **Backend architecture** → Infrastructure Spec (`docs/spec/`)

## Contributing Process

### Step 1: Identify the Right Location

Use the decision tree above to determine where your content belongs.

### Step 2: Create Your File

Create a `.mdx` file in the appropriate directory with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "One-line description"
icon: "icon-name"
---
```

### Step 3: Update Navigation

Add your page to `docs/docs.json` in the appropriate tab and group.

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request

```bash
git checkout -b docs/your-feature
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: add [description]"
git push origin docs/your-feature
```
