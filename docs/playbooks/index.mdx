<Badge text="development" color="orange" />

These playbooks provide step-by-step tutorials for building AI agents on AMD AI PCs. Each explains implementation details and architectural decisions.

<Info>
**Built for AI PCs:** All agents run locally on Ryzen AI hardware (NPU/iGPU acceleration) for private, fast AI processing.
</Info>

<Info>
**What makes playbooks different?**

Unlike reference documentation, playbooks are **journey-based tutorials** that:
- Start with a working example in 5 minutes
- Build complexity incrementally
- Explain what happens "under the hood"
- Include production deployment patterns
- Provide reusable code you can extend
