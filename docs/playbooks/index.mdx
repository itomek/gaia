<Badge text="development" color="orange" />

These playbooks provide step-by-step tutorials for building AI agents on AMD AI PCs. Each explains implementation details and architectural decisions.

<Info>
**Built for AI PCs:** All agents run locally on Ryzen AI hardware (NPU/iGPU acceleration) for private, fast AI processing.
</Info>

<Info>
**What makes playbooks different?**

Unlike reference documentation, playbooks are **journey-based tutorials** that:
- Start with a working example in 5 minutes
- Build complexity incrementally
- Explain what happens "under the hood"
- Include production deployment patterns
- Provide reusable code you can extend
</Info>

## How to Use Playbooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your playbook">
    Pick a use case that matches your needs. Each playbook is self-contained.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow the journey">
    Start from Step 1 and work through sequentially. Each step builds on the previous one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand the implementation">
    Read the "Under the Hood" sections to understand the technical details and design decisions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extend and customize">
    Use the "Making It Your Own" sections to adapt the agent for your specific use case.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to production">
    Review deployment patterns for packaging and distribution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Playbook Structure

Each playbook follows this format:

<Accordion title="1. Why Build This? (Context)">
  Sets the stage - what problem does this solve? What will you build?
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Quick Start (5 min)">
  Minimal working example to verify setup and understand basic usage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Architecture Overview">
  Visual diagram showing how components fit together.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Understanding Components">
  Deep dive into each piece with "under the hood" explanations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. Step-by-Step Build">
  Incremental construction - each step adds one feature and explains it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="6. Making It Your Own">
  Customization patterns, extensions, and advanced use cases.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="7. Production Deployment">
  API servers, CLI tools, and distribution patterns.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="8. Real-World Examples">
  Complete, copy-paste ready examples for common scenarios.
</Accordion>
