# GAIA SDK Reference

<Badge text="development" color="orange" />

**Version:** 0.14.0+
**Last Updated:** December 2025

## What is GAIA?

GAIA (Generative AI Is Awesome) is AMD's framework for building **intelligent AI agents** that run locally on your computer—no cloud required. Think of it as a toolkit for creating AI assistants that can:

- Answer questions by searching through documents
- Process images and extract information
- Interact with databases
- Respond to voice commands
- Automate workflows
- And much more!

**Who is this for?**
- Developers building custom AI agents
- Teams creating specialized AI workflows
- Researchers experimenting with AI applications
- Anyone wanting to run AI locally on AMD hardware

**What makes GAIA special?**
- 🏠 **Privacy**: Everything runs on your machine
- ⚡ **Speed**: AMD NPU/iGPU acceleration
- 🔧 **Flexibility**: Build exactly what you need
- 📦 **Distribution**: Share agents via `pip install`

## Quick Start

### Understanding AI Agents

Before we dive in, let's understand what an **AI agent** is:

**Traditional Program:**
```
User input → Your code → Output
```

**AI Agent:**
```
User input → LLM decides what to do → Calls your tools → LLM formats output → User gets answer
```

**Why is this powerful?**
- Users talk naturally: "Find customers in Texas and email them"
- LLM breaks it down: Use `search_customers` tool, then `send_email` tool
- Your code just provides the tools, LLM orchestrates them
- No complex if/else logic needed!

### Installation

**Using uv (recommended - 10-100x faster than pip):**

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # Linux
# or
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex  # Windows PowerShell

# Install GAIA
uv pip install amd-gaia
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Lemonade Server running (for local LLM inference)
  ```bash
  # Start Lemonade Server
  lemonade-server serve
  ```

**Why uv?**
- ⚡ 10-100x faster than pip
- 🔒 Better dependency resolution
- 📦 Recommended by GAIA team

### Your First Agent (5 Minutes)

Let's build a simple agent that can search and analyze data:

```python
from gaia.agents.base.agent import Agent
from gaia.agents.base.tools import tool

class MyAgent(Agent):
    """Custom agent for my use case."""

    # Step 1: Tell the agent its purpose
    def _get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
        return "You are a helpful assistant that can search and analyze data."

    # Step 2: Choose how to display output
    def _create_console(self):
        from gaia.agents.base.console import AgentConsole
        return AgentConsole()  # Rich CLI output with colors

    # Step 3: Define tools the agent can use
    def _register_tools(self):
        @tool
        def search_data(query: str) -> dict:
            """Search for data matching the query."""
            # Your implementation here
            # This is what actually gets called when LLM decides to search
            return {"results": ["item1", "item2"], "count": 2}

        @tool
        def analyze_data(data_id: str) -> dict:
            """Analyze a specific data item."""
            # Your implementation here
            return {"analysis": "Data is valid", "confidence": 0.95}

# Step 4: Use the agent
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = MyAgent()

    # User talks naturally
    result = agent.process_query("Search for user data and analyze it")

    # LLM automatically:
    # 1. Calls search_data("user")
    # 2. Calls analyze_data("item1")
    # 3. Formats a natural response

    print(result)
```

**What just happened?**
1. You defined **tools** (search_data, analyze_data)
2. You described the agent's **personality** (system prompt)
3. The agent **automatically** figured out which tools to call and in what order
4. The LLM **orchestrated** the workflow based on user's natural language

**That's it!** You've created an AI agent.
