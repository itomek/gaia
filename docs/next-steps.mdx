<Info>
  **Prerequisites:** Complete the [Quickstart](/quickstart) first to understand the basic agent structure.
</Info>

The quickstart showed you how to build a simple agent. Let's build something more practical: an agent that analyzes your system hardware and recommends which LLMs you can run locally.

## Hardware Advisor Agent

An agent that answers "What size LLM can I run?" based on your actual hardware.

<Card title="Hardware Advisor Playbook" icon="microchip" href="/playbooks/hardware-advisor/part-1-getting-started">
  Learn to build an agent that detects RAM, GPU, NPU and recommends models based on your system specs.
</Card>

**Quick try:**
```bash
python examples/hardware_advisor_agent.py
```

**Example questions:**
- "What size LLM can I run?"
- "Show me my system specs"
- "What models are available?"
- "Can I run a 30B model?"

See the [Hardware Advisor Guide](/guides/hardware-advisor) for usage details or the [Playbook](/playbooks/hardware-advisor/part-1-getting-started) to learn how to build it step-by-step.

## Going Further

Now that you've built an agent with real-world capabilities, here are ideas for extending it:

### Add More Tools

**File System Tools:**
```python
@tool
def search_files(pattern: str) -> dict:
    """Search for files matching a pattern."""
    import glob
    files = glob.glob(pattern, recursive=True)
    return {"files": files, "count": len(files)}
```

**Web Search Tools:**
```python
@tool
def search_web(query: str) -> dict:
    """Search the web for information."""
    # Integrate with search APIs
    pass
```

**Database Tools:**
Mix in `DatabaseMixin` like the Notes Agent example to persist data:

```python
from gaia import Agent, DatabaseMixin, tool

class MyAgent(Agent, DatabaseMixin):
    def __init__(self, db_path: str = "data/my_agent.db", **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.init_db(db_path)
```

See `examples/notes_agent.py` for a complete database example.

### Improve the System Prompt

A better prompt makes a smarter agent:

```python
def _get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
    return """You are an expert system administrator.

When users ask questions:
1. Always check actual data using tools before answering
2. Explain your reasoning in simple terms
3. Suggest follow-up actions when relevant
4. If you don't know, say so - never guess

Available tools:
- get_system_info: Check hardware capabilities
- search_files: Find files on disk
- run_command: Execute shell commands safely

Be helpful, accurate, and concise."""
```

### Add Voice Interaction

See the [Voice Integration Guide](/guides/talk) to add speech recognition and text-to-speech to your agent.

### Build a Specialized Agent

Check out more complete examples:
