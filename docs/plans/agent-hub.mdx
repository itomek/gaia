---

## Strategic Goals

Beyond community engagement, GAIA Agents Hub serves three strategic objectives:

### 1. Grow the GAIA SDK Ecosystem

GAIA Agents Hub is the **distribution channel** for GAIA SDK adoption:

**Discover → Learn → Build → Publish → Adopt → *(cycle repeats)***

Every agent in the Agents Hub is a GAIA SDK showcase. Every competition drives SDK learning.

### 2. Build a Talent Pipeline

Competitions surface **top AI developers** for potential hiring:

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| Competition | Developers demonstrate skills publicly |
| Recognition | Top contributors get visibility, badges |
| Engagement | AMD team identifies standout builders |
| Opportunity | Potential hiring or partnership discussions |

**Long-term:** Top community contributors could become official AMD agent developers.

### 3. Seed Production-Ready Agents

While out of scope for initial launch, the Agents Hub builds toward:
- Agents that solve real enterprise use-cases
- Production deployment patterns
- Reference architectures for AI PC applications

The competition model validates which agents are genuinely useful before broader investment.

---

## Seed Agents

The Hub launches with **existing GAIA agents** as seed content:

| Agent | Category | Use Case | Source |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| **ChatAgent** | Documents | Document Q&A with RAG | [`agents/chat/`](/guides/chat) |
| **CodeAgent** | Code | Code generation and editing | [`agents/code/`](/guides/code) |
| **ComputerUseAgent** | Desktop | Desktop automation via MCP | [`agents/cua/`](/plans/cua) |
| **BlenderAgent** | Creative | 3D scene automation | [`agents/blender/`](/guides/blender) |
| **JiraAgent** | Productivity | Issue management with NLP | [`agents/jira/`](/guides/jira) |
| **DockerAgent** | DevOps | Container management | [`agents/docker/`](/guides/docker) |
