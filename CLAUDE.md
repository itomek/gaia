# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

GAIA (Generative AI Is Awesome) is AMD's open-source framework for running generative AI applications locally on AMD hardware, with specialized optimizations for Ryzen AI processors with NPU support.

**Key Documentation:**
- Development setup: [`docs/dev.md`](docs/dev.md)
- Code Agent: [`docs/code.md`](docs/code.md)
- All features: [`docs/features.md`](docs/features.md)

## Version Control Guidelines

### Repository Structure

This is the **gaia-pirate** repository (`aigdat/gaia`), the private repository where all GAIA development occurs. There are two related repositories:

1. **gaia-pirate** (`aigdat/gaia`) - **This repository** - Private development repository and single source of truth
2. **gaia-public** (`github.com/amd/gaia`) - Public open-source repository

**Development Workflow:**
- All development work happens in this private repository (gaia-pirate)
- **Claude will NEVER commit to the public repository** - releases are synced manually using `release.py`
- The `release.py` script filters out internal/NDA content based on an exclude list
- Files in the `./nda` directory are automatically excluded from public releases
- External contributions (issues/PRs) come through the public repository
- External contributions are manually reviewed and merged back into this private repository
- Legal review happens during the manual release process before PRs are completed in the public repo

See [`nda/docs/release.md`](nda/docs/release.md) for detailed release process documentation.

### IMPORTANT: Never Commit Changes
**NEVER commit changes to the repository unless explicitly requested by the user.** The user will decide when and what to commit. This prevents unwanted changes from being added to the repository history.

### Branch Management
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: Use descriptive names (e.g., `kalin/mcp`, `feature/new-agent`)
- Always check current branch status before making changes
- Use pull requests for merging changes to main

## Testing Philosophy

**IMPORTANT:** Always test the actual CLI commands that users will run. Never bypass the CLI by calling Python modules directly unless debugging.

```bash
# Good - test CLI commands
gaia mcp start --background
gaia mcp status

# Bad - avoid unless debugging
python -m gaia.mcp.mcp_bridge
```

## Development Workflow

**See [`docs/dev.md`](docs/dev.md)** for complete setup (using uv for fast installs), testing, and linting instructions.

**Feature documentation:** [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md), [`docs/chat.md`](docs/chat.md), [`docs/code.md`](docs/code.md), [`docs/talk.md`](docs/talk.md), [`docs/blender.md`](docs/blender.md), [`docs/jira.md`](docs/jira.md), [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md)

## Architecture

**See [`docs/dev.md`](docs/dev.md)** for detailed architecture documentation.

### Key Components
- **Agent System** (`src/gaia/agents/`): Base Agent class with tool registry, state management, error recovery
- **LLM Backend** (`src/gaia/llm/`): Lemonade Server integration for AMD-optimized inference
- **MCP Integration** (`src/gaia/mcp/`): Model Context Protocol for external integrations
- **RAG System** (`src/gaia/rag/`): Document Q&A with PDF support - see [`docs/chat.md`](docs/chat.md)
- **Evaluation** (`src/gaia/eval/`): Batch experiments and ground truth - see [`docs/eval.md`](docs/eval.md)

### Default Models
- General tasks: `Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU`
- Code/Jira: `Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF`

## File Path Rules (Workaround for Claude Code v1.0.111 Bug)
- When reading or editing a file, **ALWAYS use relative paths.**
- Example: `./src/components/Component.tsx` ✅
- **DO NOT use absolute paths.**
- Example: `C:/Users/user/project/src/components/Component.tsx` ❌
- Reason: This is a workaround for a known bug in Claude Code v1.0.111 (GitHub Issue
- when you invoke a particular proactive agent from @.claude\agents\, make sure to indicate what agent you are invoking in your response back to the user
