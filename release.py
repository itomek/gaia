# Requirement: `pip install black`
# 
# This script releases the approved sections of aigdat/gaia to the open source repo.
# 
# At the time of this writing, we are releasing the core functionality while keeping some
# internal tools and configurations private.
# 
# NOTE: This repo is the single source of truth (SSOT) for gaia.
# Please do not check code directly into the OSS repo!!! Only check code into this
# private repo, then use this script to sync it to the OSS repo. We don't have any tooling
# for syncing code in the other direction (public -> private).
# 
# Usage:
# 1. Make sure you already cloned the Gaia OSS repo on to your hard drive.
#    We'll use C:\work\gaia as an example clone.
# 2. Create a branch in the clone
# 3. NOTE: if aigdat/gaia moved any files already checked into the clone, you need
#    to `git mv` those files in the clone to the expected location before proceeding.
# 4. Run `python release.py -o C:\work\gaia` to sync changes from aigdat/gaia
#    into your Gaia OSS clone.
# 5. Use `git add` to add any new files. NOTE: be mindful when doing this! Make sure that
#    no internal/NDA files slipped through the filters.
# 6. Use `git commit -am MESSAGE` and `git push` to sync your updates to the server.
# 7. Launch a PR for your branch on the OSS repo.
# 
# Details of operation:
# - All source files under src/gaia are copied, except those that violate the
#   `exclude` list filter.
#   - NOTE: the `--internal` arg disables the exclude filter! Only use this when
#     syncing to an AMD-internal clone.
# - The script uses Git to identify tracked files in the source repository
# - Files are filtered based on an exclude list to prevent internal/NDA content from being copied
# - The script creates the necessary directory structure in the target repository
# - The script copies all files and then updates all markdown files with correct github links
# - The script prints out which files will be copied, which are excluded, and their destination paths
